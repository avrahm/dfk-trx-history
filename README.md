## How to use
Search by Address: Searching by address will show you all transactions for that address and will not store any data.
Connect your wallet: Connecting your wallet only grabs the address from MetaMask and remains connected.

## How is your wallet connected?
We check if your wallet is connected by asking MetaMask if you've authorized the app. MetaMask only provides the wallet address.

Disconnecting your wallet will remove the link between your MetaMask and this site.

To disconnect: Follow this guide from MetaMask support. [Disconnect wallet from Dapp](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059535551-Disconnect-wallet-from-Dapp)
